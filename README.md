# Employee Management System â€“ SQL Mini Project

This folder contains a set of SQL queries built around an Employee Management System using JOIN operations.

The goal of this mini project is to demonstrate how to retrieve, combine, and analyze employee-related data across multiple tables such as `employees`, `departments`, and `salaries`.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

The HR department wants detailed reports combining employee records, their department information, and salary data. This project solves that by writing JOIN-based queries to generate useful HR reports.

## ðŸ§© Files in This Folder

- `1_all_employees_with_department.sql` â€“ List all employees with department and salary info
- `2_avg_salary_by_department.sql` â€“ Calculate average salary per department
- `3_highest_paid_employee.sql` â€“ Find the highest paid employee in each department
- `4_recent_joins.sql` â€“ List employees who joined in the last 6 months
- `5_employee_count_per_department.sql` â€“ Count of employees per department
- `6_top_salary_payout_department.sql` â€“ Department with the highest total salary payout

## ðŸ›  SQL Concepts Used

- `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`
- `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `HAVING`
- Aggregate functions: `AVG()`, `SUM()`, `MAX()`
- Filtering with `WHERE` and `INTERVAL`
